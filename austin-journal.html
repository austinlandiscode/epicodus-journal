  <h3>Week 1 Questions & Answers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing 27 weeks of technical training?</li>
    <p>I have considered a career in programming off and on for several years now, one of my best friends went through the Epicodus program, and four years removed is very succesful. There were many ups and downs in his journey the past four years, but one thing he does not regret in his life is going to a code school. I'm hoping to feel the same way in four years.</p>
    <li>Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?</li>
    <p>I have an internship lined up after the intership that epicodus provides us, and my short term goal is to get hired after my intership is up. I would love to land a junior developer job within a year of graduating from epicodus and a senior developer job within 5 years.</p>

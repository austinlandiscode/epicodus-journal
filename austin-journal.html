  <h1>Austin's Epicodus Journal</h1>
  <h3>Week 1 Questions & Answers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing 27
      weeks of technical training?</li>
    <p>I have considered a career in programming off and on for several years now, one of my best friends went through
      the Epicodus program, and four years removed is very succesful. There were many ups and downs in his journey the
      past four years, but one thing he does not regret in his life is going to a code school. I'm hoping to feel the
      same way in four years.</p>
    <li>Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?</li>
    <p>I have an internship lined up after the intership that epicodus provides us, and my short term goal is to get
      hired after my intership is up. I would love to land a junior developer job within a year of graduating from
      epicodus and a senior developer job within 5 years.</p>
  </ul>
  <h3>Week 2 Questions & Answers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Think about asking for help in the classroom. Are there times when it's easier or harder for you to ask for
      assistance from a peer? What about a teacher?</li>
    <p>I love asking for help in this environment, sometimes I feel like I ask for help too quickly when the answer
      might be a quick google search and some elbow grease away.</p>
    <li>What factors make it harder to ask for help? Why do these stand in your way?</li>
    <p>I feel the only time I have a hard time asking for help is when my ego gets in the way, which is not beneficial
      for anyone.</p>
    <li>What can you do to minimize or eliminate these factors? In what ways could you practice sharing your problem
      solving process throughout the week?</li>
    <p>Once I learn something, it is very beneficial for me to teach it to someone else a few times. It really helps
      reinforce the information into my head. Plus no matter how time consuming it is, I really benefit from just
      coding. coding. coding. More time spent doing it, the better I get. My problem solving process is still under
      progress, I am trying to obtain some more patience, and building the skill of a google search.</p>
